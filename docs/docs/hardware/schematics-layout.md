# Board Schematics

The schematics for the `TINY` and `MINI` boards are provided in SVG format,
which allows for infinite scaling without any loss of detail. This makes them
ideal for inspection, printing, or embedding in other documents. Simply click on
any image to view it full-size in your browser or download it directly for
offline use.
