# Why the 65C02?

The choice of the **WDC 65C02** as the core processor for the ByteCradle
platform is deliberate and based on technical, historical, and practical
considerations.

## Historical Significance

The 6502 microprocessor family has played a pivotal role in the history of
computing. Introduced in 1975 by MOS Technology, the 6502 quickly became known
for its simplicity, affordability, and effectiveness. It powered many
influential computing systems of the late 1970s and 1980s, including:

- The Commodore 64
- The Apple II series
- The Atari 8-bit computers
- Early game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System (via a 6502
  derivative)

The 6502 architecture became a foundation for both educational and commercial
computing, introducing many engineers to low-level system design and
programming. Choosing a 6502-based system connects users directly with these
historical roots, providing a platform to understand the fundamental design
principles that shaped modern computing.

## Ongoing Availability

Unlike many processors from the same era, the 65C02 is still **in production
today**, manufactured by the **Western Design Center (WDC)**.  
This continued availability ensures:

- Reliable sourcing from multiple vendors.
- Use of modern fabrication techniques, increasing consistency and reducing
  power consumption.
- Long-term support for educational and experimental projects.

This availability makes the 65C02 a practical choice for a new hardware
platform, avoiding the need to rely on discontinued or obsolete components.

## Advantages of the 65C02

The **65C02** is a **CMOS** version of the original NMOS 6502, bringing several
improvements while maintaining compatibility with the original architecture:

- **Higher clock frequencies**:  
  The CMOS design allows the 65C02 to operate reliably at significantly higher
  clock speeds than the original 6502.

- **Reduced power consumption**:  
  CMOS fabrication reduces energy requirements, making the system more efficient
  and better suited for modern embedded or battery-powered applications.

- **Expanded instruction set and corrections**:  
  The 65C02 adds new instructions, removes some undefined behaviors of the
  original 6502, and introduces small enhancements that simplify system
  programming.

These technical improvements result in a processor that maintains historical
relevance while providing better performance, reliability, and usability for
contemporary designs.

## Summary

The selection of the 65C02 for the ByteCradle platform reflects a balance
between historical appreciation and practical engineering:

- It connects users with the foundations of 8-bit computing.
- It provides a readily available, robust, and energy-efficient processor.
- It allows exploration of both classic and expanded 6502 programming
  techniques.

By using the 65C02, the platform offers a reliable and instructive environment
for studying fundamental computer engineering concepts on real hardware.
