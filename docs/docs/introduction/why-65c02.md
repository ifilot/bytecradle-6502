## Choosing the Right CPU

At the outset of this project, one of the most critical decisions was selecting
a CPU architecture. Several classic 8-bit and 16-bit processors were considered
— notably the **MOS 6502**, **Zilog Z80**, and **Intel 8088/8086**.

Each of these CPUs played a foundational role in early personal computing.
However, important practical considerations shaped the final choice:

- The **8088/8086**, though historically significant, is no longer in
  production.
- The **Z80**, another strong contender, also recently ceased production —
  though both it and the 8086 remain available through surplus and legacy
  channels.
- The **WDC 65C02**, a modern CMOS variant of the original 6502, is **still in
  active production**. It not only has robust commercial support but also
  carries the legacy of influential systems like the **Apple II**, **Commodore
  64**, **BBC Micro**, and **NES**.

This combination of **availability**, **legacy**, and **technical elegance**
made the 65C02 a natural choice.

## Instruction Set Simplicity

One of the most compelling arguments in favor of the 6502 — especially for a
learning-oriented platform — is its **simplicity**. Its architecture and
instruction set are compact and easy to grasp, making it particularly
approachable for those new to assembly language or low-level system design.

Here's a comparative look at instruction set sizes:

| CPU      | Approximate Number of Instructions | Notes                                                                 |
|----------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 6502     | ~56                                | Small, minimal instruction set; easy to memorize                      |
| 65C02    | ~70                                | Enhanced 6502 with additional instructions and fixed quirks           |
| 65C816   | ~92                                | 16-bit extension of 65C02; backward-compatible, adds new registers    |
| 8080     | ~78                                | Slightly more complex, more registers than 6502                       |
| Z80      | ~158                               | Includes extended opcodes, prefixes, and register pairs               |
| 8086/88  | ~133                               | 16-bit instructions, multi-byte ops, complex syntax and segments      |

!!! note 
    Instruction counts are approximate because architectures differ in how
    they handle prefixes, variants, addressing modes, and unofficial or
    undocumented opcodes. Extended CPUs (like Z80 or 65C816) often reuse base
    instructions with added functionality.

While instruction count isn't the sole measure of complexity, it does reflect
how **minimal and focused** the 6502 is. In contrast, the 8080 and Z80 offer
richer feature sets that can also present steeper learning curves.

!!! note "Subjectivity note" 
    The ease of programming in assembly is naturally a
    matter of opinion. However, there is broad consensus that the 6502 is
    **beginner-friendly**, largely due to its straightforward instruction set
    and predictable behavior.

By building this platform around the 6502, we aim to blend **historical
relevance** with **practical accessibility**, offering a compelling environment
for both exploration and education in low-level computing.
